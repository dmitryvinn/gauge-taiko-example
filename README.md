# Gauge+Taiko Example
## Overview
Another (and final) example repository for a talk, [Gauge+Taiko: BDD for Web Revived](https://dvinnik.com/talks/testing/gauge-taiko-bdd-for-web-revived/).

In this demo, we look at how Gauge can be used along with Taiko to simplify not only the automation process, but also communication through markdown format of its specs and user-friendly reports.
To better show the power of Taiko, during the talk we write one of the scenarios shown in this repo using the terminal in just few steps, and then deploy it in CI.
